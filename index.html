            <h2>Chapter 1: The Dawn of Jafetism</h2>
            <p>In the beginning, there was only darkness, and from that darkness emerged Jafet, the benevolent creator. With wisdom and love, Jafet shaped the universe, bringing light and life to all existence.</p>
            <p>Jafetism teaches us to cherish the gift of creation and to seek knowledge, for in knowledge, we find the divine spark that connects us to our creator.</p>
